## About

Here are some additional explanations for this book.

First of all, let me explain the difference between the positioning and the official document. The official Chinese documentation is indeed very complete, but its positioning is the official Wiki, so it is already necessary to do everything in detail. But this kind of overly detailed documentation can make newbies get lost in link after link, and they need guidance more than a dictionary. The positioning of this article is a guide, and what we think is the current better solution. In addition, most of the official Chinese documents are translated from English documents, and there are cases where the translation is not timely. There are a few cases where the translation is wrong or the meaning is unclear.

There are a lot of similar documents on the Internet, why do you need such a document? Technological changes are changing with each passing day. Whether it is the operating system itself or valuable software, some online tutorials are mostly in disrepair. Everyone knows that the timeliness of Internet knowledge is very important. The flag of this book is that it will be updated as long as it is alive. And determined to achieve a better position in the Chinese community.

Many people still think that Linux is not suitable as an operating system for everyday use. Let's be honest, the Linux desktop really wasn't usable in the first decade of this century. But now the time is after 2021, and the Linux desktop and ecology have made great progress. Whether it is office, light entertainment or programming, it can basically meet the needs.
